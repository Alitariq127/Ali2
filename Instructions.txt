# 🧭 AI Agent Pathfinding with A* in Pygame

This Python project demonstrates an AI agent solving a maze using the A* pathfinding algorithm. Built with Pygame, it visualizes step-by-step traversal from a start to a goal cell in real time.

## 🚀 Features

- A* Algorithm implementation
- Grid-based maze structure
- Real-time agent movement visualization
- Step-by-step console output

## 🧩 How It Works

- The agent starts at the top-left cell (0, 0) and finds the shortest path to the bottom-right cell (9, 9).
- Obstacles are represented by `1`s in the grid.
- The path is shown in green, the agent in blue, and the goal in red.

## 🧑‍💻 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame

Install requirements using:
```bash
pip install pygame
